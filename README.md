## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java 22 or higher
* Maven
* Docker and Docker Compose

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/clientservercoursework.git](https://github.com/your-username/clientservercoursework.git)
    cd clientservercoursework
    ```

2.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project, based on `env.sample` (if one exists) or with the following content:
    ```
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_NAME=investfolio_db
    DB_USER=user
    DB_PASS=password
    ```

3.  **Start MySQL with Docker Compose:**
    This command will run a MySQL database container in the background.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d mysqlDb
    ```
    *Note: Your `docker-compose.yml` specifies port "3307:3307". Make sure it is not occupied.*

4.  **Run the Java application:**
    You can run the server directly from your IDE by executing the `main` method in `org.example.Main`, or by building the project with Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    java -jar target/CourseWork-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
    The server will start at `http://localhost:8080`.

## üß™ Testing

The project includes a suite of integration tests to verify the logic of the services and database interactions. To run the tests, execute the command:
```bash
mvn test
```
